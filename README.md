# Evaluating the Performance of Optimizers on the Loss Landscape of Quantum Neural Networks
Experiment/Code for reproduction of results for "Evaluating the Performance of Optimizers on the Loss Landscape of Quantum Neural Networks" research project by Serhat Ceri, Jonathan Klenk, Alina Mürwald, Anna Volpe (2024).
The Code is adapted from Victor Ülger's master thesis "Analyzing the Effect of Entanglement of Training Samples on the Loss Landscape of Quantum Neural Networks" (2024).

**TODO**: 

code/entangled_qnn_trainging-main/project-qnn-opt-experiments.ipynb contains the main experiments methods. 
  
**TODO**: The experiment results from the thesis can be found in /experimental_results under the  run id ``16_6_4_10_13_3_14``.  
Graphics used in the thesis can be found in /Graphics  

## Dependencies
**TODO: UPDATE**

The code contained in this repository requires the following dependencies for reproducing the experiments:
- matplotlib==3.5.2
- networkx==2.8.8
- numpy==1.24.1
- orqviz==0.5.0
- PennyLane==0.27.0
- scipy==1.13.1
- torch==2.0.0

Install dependencies using ``pip install -r requirements.txt``  
Python 3.9.13 is the version the experiments were run on.
